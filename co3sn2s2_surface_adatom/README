This system is a model of a Co3Sn2S2 surface with a single S atom adsorbed.  Various combinations of mixing_beta/degauss were tried.  

Limited computational resources were used here, so this might turn out to be an easier challenge case in the limit of larger iteration counts.

The SCF here was attempted with a mix of "softer" potentials.  It would be good to assess convergence properties when all ccECP potentials (and a ~700 Ry cutoff) are used instead.
