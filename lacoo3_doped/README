co.mn.para
    Co atom is replaced by Mn in LaCoO3 with AFM spin order. 
    The magnetization of Mn is parallel to the replaced Co. 

co.ni.para
    Co atom is replaced by Ni in LaCoO3 with AFM spin order. 
    The magnetization of Ni is parallel to the replaced Co. 

We encountered the same issue for both cases:
the 'estimated scf accuracy' vibrates above 2e-5 and does not get reduced further. 

The QE output files are 

    scf.out.1: mixing_beta=0.2
    scf.out.2: mixing_beta=0.1

The smaller mixing_beta did not work to solve the issue.
