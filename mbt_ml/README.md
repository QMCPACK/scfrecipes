## Monolayer MBT: FM ordering+SOC+PBE
Located in the `mbt_ml` directory, there are example attempts to run MBT in
FM ordering with fully relativistic potentials and using the PBE+U
functional

* In the `pbe_plus_u_0.1eV` directory, the PBE+U=0.1eV functional is tried
* In the `pbe_plus_u_4.0eV` directory, the PBE+U=4eV functional is tried

In both cases, convergence is not reached after many iterations
