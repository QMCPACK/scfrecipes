slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 1896219 ON or-condo-c256 CANCELLED AT 2021-10-23T01:57:15 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[19622,0],0] on node or-condo-c256
  Remote daemon: [[19622,0],6] on node or-condo-c499

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
